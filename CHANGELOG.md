# Changelog

All notable changes to the ERPClaw foundation skill.

## [4.0.2] — 2026-05-04

Eliminate F1 (Rogue Agents / cron) Concern from the ClawHub OpenClaw review by removing decorative `cron:` blocks from foundation and grouped-addons SKILL.md files.

### Why

Phase 2 audit verification (B1) discovered that OpenClaw's runtime cron daemon does NOT auto-discover SKILL.md `cron:` blocks. Active scheduling requires explicit `openclaw cron add` CLI commands. The `cron:` block in foundation SKILL.md was therefore decorative metadata, not active scheduling — but the ClawHub static analyzer was reading it as scheduled financial mutation and flagging F1 as HIGH/Concern.

Removing the decorative blocks eliminates the trigger at the source without changing operational behavior (no user has ever had ERPClaw crons running automatically from `clawhub install`; users wanting daily jobs always had to run `openclaw cron add` manually).

### Changed
- **Foundation `SKILL.md`**: removed the entire `cron:` block (4 entries: process-recurring, generate-recurring-invoices, check-reorder, check-overdue). Replaced "Background automation" prose section with "Optional scheduling" pointer to `openclaw cron add` for users who want daily jobs.
- **`erpclaw-growth` SKILL.md** (grouped addon): removed 1 cron entry (weekly anomaly detection sweep).
- **`erpclaw-ops` SKILL.md** (grouped addon): removed 3 cron entries (monthly depreciation, daily overdue issues, weekly SLA compliance).
- **Library self-heal disclosure** kept as standalone subsection (was bundled with cron prose in v4.0.1).
- Foundation `version: 4.0.1` → `4.0.2`.
- `erpclaw_lib/__version__ = "4.0.2"`.
- `module_registry.json` top-level `version: "4.0.2"`.

### Notes
- No code paths read SKILL.md cron blocks. Verified via grep across `source/`, `managers/`, `scripts/` — zero hits for cron-block consumption.
- All 4 daily action targets (`process-recurring`, `generate-recurring-invoices`, `check-reorder`, `check-overdue`) remain in foundation as on-demand callable actions. No capability removed.
- Users who want automatic daily runs use `openclaw cron add --name <id> --cron "<expr>" --message "Using erpclaw, run the <action> action."` — the same path that was always required for actual scheduling.
- Plan + audit + B1 verification: `apps/CLAWHUB_FIX_v402_PLAN_2026-05-04.md` + `apps/CLAWHUB_FIX_v402_AUDIT_2026-05-04.md` + this CHANGELOG entry.

### Migration arc

| Version | Cron in foundation SKILL.md | Cron actually running on install |
|---|---|---|
| v3.5.1 | 4 entries, `announce: false` | NO (decorative only) |
| v4.0.0 | 4 entries, `announce: false` | NO |
| v4.0.1 | 4 entries, `announce: true` | NO |
| v4.0.2 | none | NO (unchanged — same as all prior) |

The "migration" is operationally a no-op. Only the SKILL.md text changed.

## [4.0.1] — 2026-05-04

Security patch responding to ClawHub OpenClaw v4.0.0 review findings. Documentation, defaults, and disclosure changes; no schema changes, no new actions.

### Changed
- **Cron jobs now announce.** All four daily background jobs (`process-recurring`, `generate-recurring-invoices`, `check-reorder`, `check-overdue`) flipped from `announce: false` to `announce: true`. Each run is now visible in the OpenClaw activity feed. (Resolves OpenClaw v4.0.0 finding "Rogue Agents" HIGH/Concern.)
- **README scrub.** Removed "Self-Extending ERP" section from foundation README. Module-generation prose lives in the optional `erpclaw-os-engine` addon README only. (Resolves OpenClaw v4.0.0 finding "Unexpected Code Execution" MEDIUM/Concern.)
- **Foundation SKILL.md actions table** no longer advertises the ~30 module-authoring / DGM / heartbeat / semantic-check actions that moved to `erpclaw-os-engine` in v4.0.0. Replaced with a single pointer to the optional addon. Removed `generate-module` and `deploy-module` from the "always confirm" list (now addon-only).
- **Addon SKILL.md description** reworded to lead with developer-tooling framing and explicit sandbox-first / user-approval-before-deploy disclosure.

### Added
- **Credential handling, Data protection, Module installation safety** paragraphs in foundation SKILL.md security section. Mirror the OpenClaw recommendations for F3-F5 Note-level findings.
- **Background automation** section in foundation SKILL.md documenting the four cron jobs and the lib bootstrap self-heal behavior.
- **chmod 600 on `data.sqlite`, `data.sqlite-wal`, `data.sqlite-shm`** — applied at `initialize-database`, after `restore-database`, after `backup-database`, AND on every foundation action invocation. Backup outputs are also chmod 600. New helper `chmod_db_files()` in `erpclaw-setup/db_query.py`.
- **Lib bootstrap self-heal** (`erpclaw_lib/_bootstrap.py`). On every foundation action invocation, the router compares the bundled `erpclaw_lib.__version__` to a marker file at `~/.openclaw/erpclaw/lib/.erpclaw_lib_version`. On mismatch, it re-syncs the deployed `erpclaw_lib/` from the bundled source, writes a new marker, and appends an entry to `~/.openclaw/erpclaw/logs/bootstrap.log`. Eliminates the v3.5.1 → v4.0.0 upgrade gotcha where `clawhub update` skipped the foundation post-install hook and addon `sandbox.py` couldn't find the new `gl_invariants.py`. Honors `ERPCLAW_DISABLE_BOOTSTRAP=1` env var as an explicit opt-out.
- **`__version__ = "4.0.1"`** declared in `erpclaw_lib/__init__.py` as the canonical lib version.

### Fixed
- `restore-database` now explicitly chmods the restored DB file to 0o600 (previously inherited mode from the backup source via `shutil.copy2`).

### Notes
- The 3 Note-level OpenClaw findings (Agentic Supply Chain, Identity & Privilege Abuse, Memory and Context Poisoning) remain at Note status by design — they describe disclosed-and-accepted ERP behavior, and the recommendations are user-side practices (use scope-limited keys, rotate credentials, restrict file permissions, test imports against a separate DB). v4.0.1 mirrors those recommendations in the SKILL.md security section.
- Keychain integration, SQLite encryption-at-rest, and module signature verification remain on the v4.1+ roadmap.

## [4.0.0] — 2026-05-04

Architectural split. ClawHub static-analysis CRITs eliminated. `clawhub install erpclaw` works without `--force`.

### Changed
- **Foundation / addon split.** 21 dev-time files (`generate_module.py`, `in_module_generator.py`, `sandbox.py`, etc.) moved out of foundation to a new optional addon, `erpclaw-os-engine` v1.0.0, distributed via GitHub-only at `avansaber/erpclaw-addons` subdir `erpclaw-os-engine`. The addon trips the same scanner the foundation used to trip; isolating it keeps foundation users scan-clean.
- **`os-` prefix on 28 user-facing actions** that moved to the addon (`os-generate-module`, `os-deploy-module`, etc.). Foundation router emits a structured migration error JSON for legacy bare-name calls.
- **`gl_invariant_checker` extracted to `erpclaw_lib.gl_invariants`** for cross-package import. Foundation runtime keeps the 12-step GL validation; addon's sandbox imports from `erpclaw_lib.gl_invariants`.
- **Foundation `scripts/erpclaw-os/`** retains 7 runtime actions only: `validate-module`, `list-articles`, `build-table-registry`, `schema-{plan,apply,rollback,drift}`.

### Added
- `erpclaw-os-engine` SKILL.md, db_query.py, web_dashboard.py, sandbox.py — addon entry points.
- Foundation-locator pattern in addon's `db_query.py` (3-candidate sys.path resolution: env, prod, repo-relative).

### Notes
- ClawHub release id: `k974yxfap664grmdnxfsstnhy5863wfa`.
- Plan: `apps/CLAWHUB_FIX_C_PLAN_2026-05-04.md`. Audit: `apps/CLAWHUB_FIX_C_AUDIT_2026-05-04.md`.
