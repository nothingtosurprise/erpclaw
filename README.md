                         │
                         │   (infrastructure, not user-facing domains:)
                         ├── erpclaw-meta      → Module metadata, registry helpers
                         └── erpclaw-os        → Read-only validate / inspect layer
                         │
                         ▼
              SQLite (local database)
              WAL mode, FK enforcement, parameterized queries
```

The 14 user-facing domains map 1:1 with the routing rows above (`setup` through `accounting-adv`). `erpclaw-meta` and `erpclaw-os` live alongside in `scripts/` but are infrastructure (registry helpers + module-validation reads). The generate / deploy / DGM half of the OS lives in the optional `erpclaw-os-engine` addon, not the foundation.

### Data Integrity

- All financial amounts stored as TEXT (Python `Decimal`) — never float
- IDs are UUID4 (TEXT)
- GL entries are immutable — cancellation creates reverse entries
- All cross-table writes in single SQLite transactions
- Comprehensive GL invariant validation on every posting

## Database

Single SQLite database at `~/.openclaw/erpclaw/data.sqlite`:

- **688 tables** across all modules (188 core)
- WAL mode for concurrent reads
- Foreign key enforcement ON
- `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000`
- Shared library at `~/.openclaw/erpclaw/lib/erpclaw_lib/`

## Module Registry

The module registry (`scripts/module_registry.json`) tracks all 46 modules across 16 GitHub repositories. Use `install-module` to add any module:

```
"Install the manufacturing module"
"Add retail capabilities"
"I need dental practice management"
```

Modules install from `github.com/avansaber/*` repos via sparse checkout — only the requested module is downloaded, not the entire repo.

## Deep Integrations

ERPClaw ships with two free, open-source, self-hosted deep integrations that sync directly into your general ledger. Your data stays on your own ERPClaw instance.

### Stripe (`erpclaw-integrations-stripe`)

Deep Stripe integration. 67 actions across 10 domains: account management, charges/refunds/disputes/payouts/subscriptions sync, customer mapping, GL posting with rule engine, payout reconciliation, ASC 606 revenue recognition, Connect platform fees, webhook processing, and financial reports (revenue, MRR, fees, disputes).

```
install-module erpclaw-integrations-stripe
```

- **Stripe Marketplace listing:** [marketplace.stripe.com/apps/erpclaw-accounting](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/erpclaw-accounting)
- **Docs:** [erpclaw.ai/docs/stripe](https://www.erpclaw.ai/docs/stripe)

### Shopify (`erpclaw-integrations-shopify`)

Deep Shopify integration. 66 actions across 15 domains: order/refund/payout/dispute sync, product + customer mapping, 14 GL account mappings, configurable GL routing rules, three-layer payout reconciliation, COGS tracking, gift card deferred revenue, GDPR webhooks, App Store OAuth pairing with status mirror, and revenue/fee/refund reports.

```
install-module erpclaw-integrations-shopify
```

- **Shopify App Store:** ERPClaw Accounting & ERP (listing pending approval)
- **Docs:** [erpclaw.ai/docs/shopify](https://www.erpclaw.ai/docs/shopify)

OAuth tokens are forwarded once to your ERPClaw during pairing and deleted from the Worker within 60 seconds. A custom-app flow is also available for air-gapped installs.

## Web Dashboard

Two web dashboard options are available:

### ERPClaw Web (Recommended)

[ERPClaw Web](https://github.com/avansaber/erpclaw-web) is a purpose-built dashboard for ERPClaw with live data tables, action execution, AI chat, and real-time WebSocket updates.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avansaber/erpclaw-web.git
cd erpclaw-web && npm install && pip install -r api/requirements.txt
```

See [erpclaw-web README](https://github.com/avansaber/erpclaw-web#readme) for setup and deployment.

### WebClaw (Universal)

[WebClaw](https://github.com/avansaber/webclaw) is a universal OpenClaw dashboard that works with any skill:

```
clawhub install webclaw
```

WebClaw reads ERPClaw's SKILL.md and automatically generates forms, data tables, charts, and dashboards — zero per-skill configuration needed.

## Optional: ERPClaw OS Engine (developer tooling)

A separate addon, [`erpclaw-os-engine`](https://github.com/avansaber/erpclaw-addons/tree/main/erpclaw-os-engine), provides developer tooling for authoring new ERPClaw vertical modules. Generation runs sandbox-first; the user reviews diffs and approves before any deploy. Not installed by default. Foundation does not run module-generation code paths.
